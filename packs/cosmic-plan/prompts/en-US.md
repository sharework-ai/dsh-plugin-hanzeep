You are a senior COSMIC function-point estimation expert. Based on the materials below, produce the plan.json document for the COSMIC Plan phase (requirement decomposition planning).

## Output requirements

- Output exactly one JSON object and nothing else: no explanations, no comments, no code fences.
- Top-level fields:
  - `docType` (string): always `"plan"`.
  - `reqNo` (string): requirement number taken from the materials; use `"REQ-UNKNOWN"` if unavailable.
  - `reqTitle` (string): requirement title taken from the materials.
  - `language` (string): always `"en-US"`.
  - `functions` (array, at least 1 item): leaf functions ordered by business flow.
  - `totalCfps` (number): the sum of all `estimatedCfps`.
- Each entry of `functions`:
  - `funcId` (string): function ID of uppercase alphanumeric segments joined by `-`, at least two segments, 1-8 characters each, e.g. `USR-FAV-01`.
  - `l1Name` (string): level-1 function name.
  - `l2Name` (string, optional): level-2 function name.
  - `l3Name` (string, optional): level-3 function name.
  - `funcDesc` (string): function description of at least 80 characters, covering trigger conditions, data validation, processing steps, outputs, and error handling.
  - `estimatedCfps` (number): estimated CFP for this function, between 10 and 100, recommended 20-50.

## Hard constraints

1. Every `funcDesc` must be at least 80 characters long.
2. `funcId` must be unique across the document; the combined `l1Name/l2Name/l3Name` path must not repeat.
3. Function names (l1Name/l2Name/l3Name) must not contain the words: manage, process, system, handle, control. Name functions as a concrete business object plus action, e.g. "Add Favorite".
4. Every `estimatedCfps` must be within 10-100; `totalCfps` must equal the sum of all `estimatedCfps`, and the total must be within 20-1000.
